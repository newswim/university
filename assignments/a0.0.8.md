## Configure Crumb

Crumb combats CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) using crumb generation and validation.
See [CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) for more details about CSRF and tokens.
By default [hapijs/crumb](https://github.com/hapijs/crumb) adds a crumb token to every view context.
This allows for the token to be placed into forms and validated ensuring each request is from the proper user session.

> In order to facilitate a "transparent but visible" CSRF solution, developers are encouraged
> to adopt the [Synchronizer Token Pattern](http://www.corej2eepatterns.com/Design/PresoDesign.htm).
> The synchronizer token pattern requires the generating of random "challenge" tokens that are
> associated with the user's current session. These challenge tokens are then inserted within
> the HTML forms and links associated with sensitive server-side operations. When the user
> wishes to invoke these sensitive operations, the HTTP request should include this challenge token.
> It is then the responsibility of the server application to verify the existence and correctness
> of this token.

* Configure application to use crumb
* Configure crumb validation to exist on all: POST, PUT, DELETE, OR PATCH requests.
  Read `lib/crumbit.js` comments and [hapijs/crumb documentation](https://github.com/hapijs/crumb) for details.

## Configure [Good Hapi Process Monitor](https://github.com/hapijs/good)

#### report using:
*  good-console
*  good-file

## Generate Documentation Using  [hapijs/lout](https://github.com/hapijs/lout)

After configuring the application to use [lout](https://github.com/hapijs/lout), route documentation can be viewed at: localhost:8001/docs.

## 100% test coverage required

### Assignment Helps
[npm/newww](https://github.com/npm/newww)(depricated) project has helpful crumb examples but as of the
last time checked, it does not use the restful configuration which `git checkout assignment8` does.
